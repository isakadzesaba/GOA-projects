            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <p><b>Political Context</b> The battle occurred during a period of intense conflict between the Georgian Kingdom and 
                the Seljuq Empire over control of the Caucasus region.</p>
            <p><b>Military Strength</b> The Seljuq Empire, at the time, was a formidable force with a well-trained army and a vast territory.
                However, the Georgian Kingdom
                under David IV had been steadily consolidating its power and had developed a skilled military force.</p>
            <p><b>Leadership</b> King David IV's leadership was instrumental in rallying his troops and maintaining their morale throughout the battle.
                 His strategic vision and personal courage inspired his soldiers to fight fiercely against the Seljuq invaders.</p>    
            <p><b>Diversionary Tactics</b> King David IV employed diversionary tactics to mislead the Seljuq forces about his true intentions.
                He dispatched a small contingent of troops to launch raids on Seljuq outposts and supply lines, 
                drawing the attention of Sultan Mahmud II away from his main force.</p>
            <p><b>Preparation and Planning</b> King David IV meticulously prepared for the battle, knowing the importance of the upcoming conflict.
                He spent years building up his army, training soldiers, and forging alliances with neighboring states.</p>
