            <h2>Aftermath</h2>
            <p><b>Expansion of the Georgian Kingdom: </b> After the battle, King David embarked on a campaign to expand his kingdom further.
                He conquered several territories previously held by the Seljuks, including Tbilisi in 1122, which became the capital of the Georgian Kingdom.</p>

            <p><b>Cultural and Religious Impact: </b> The victory at Didgori had cultural and religious implications as well. Georgia became a center of Orthodox Christianity in the region,
                and the Georgian Church gained more autonomy. Additionally, the victory boosted the morale of
                 the Georgian people and solidified their identity as a Christian nation.</p>

            <p><b>Legacy of King David: </b>King David IV's reign is often considered a golden age in Georgian history. His reforms, military campaigns, 
                and promotion of culture and education laid the foundation for the Georgian Renaissance,
                a period of cultural and intellectual flourishing in the 12th and 13th centuries.</p>

            <p><b>Decline of the Seljuk Turks: </b> The Battle of Didgori was a pivotal moment in the decline of the Seljuk Turks' power in the region.
                The defeat weakened their hold over Georgia and opened the door for the eventual disintegration of their empire.</p>
            
            <p><b>Consolidation of Georgian Power: </b>The victory at Didgori solidified the power of the Georgian Kingdom under King David IV, also known as David the Builder.
                David was able to extend his control over much of modern-day Georgia, as well as parts of Armenia and Azerbaijan.</p>
